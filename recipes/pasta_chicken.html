    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 chicken tenderloins</li>
        <li>Pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp <a href="/Users/Gwen/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/spice.html"><em>Wife Spice</em></Wife></a></li>
    </ul> 
    <p></p>  
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a medium sized pot of water to boil, and a large pan to go on medium heat.</li>
        <li>As the water and pan heat, up slice your tenderloins into ~1 inch wide pieces.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, put in your pasta of choice. </li>
        <li>When the pan is hot, put your tenderloin slices into the pan. They will take ~6 minutes to cook, try to time them being fully cooked with the time your pasta finishes. </li>
        <li>Stir/flip tenderloins pieces after 3 minutes, once they are cooked turn heat off.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, strain and add to the pan with the tenderloins. Add olive oil and stir</li>
        <li>Stir well, slowly adding the Wife Spice in as you go.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
