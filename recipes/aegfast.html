    <div class="instructions">
        <ol>
            <li>Set a medium sized greased pan to heat on medium heat (4/10)</li>
            <li>When the pan is heated, crack and begin cooking both eggs, season with Wife Spice. Do not break yolks.</li>
            <li>Once the yolks are only slightly jiggly, flip the eggs and season the other side with wife spice. Put the bagels to toast.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 minutes, flip the eggs again and turn off the heat. Leave in the pan as you add cream cheese to the bagels.</li>
            <li>Lightly sprinkle some Wife Spice onto the cream cheesed bagels, then serve the eggs</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

        Gwen eats this meal <strong>Neurospicy Style</strong>:
            <ol>
                <li>Choose the worse looking bagel and eat it first</li>
                <li>Like a gremlin, seperate the first egg yolk from the white (yes, with your hands). Eat the white and sop up the extra Wife Spice with the yolk before you eat it</li>
                <li>Repeat with the second egg, and revel in perfection as you finish by eating the second half of the bagel.</li>
            </ol>
            (Deviating from this may not give maximum food enjoyment)
